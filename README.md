## Project: Ford Gobike Data Exploration

## Description
This dataset is taken from Ford GoBike System Data and represents trips taken by members of the service for month of February of 2019.

**Content**

Data consists of info about trips taken by service's members, their types, their age, their gender, stations of starting and ending trips, duration of trips etc.

## Summary of Main Findings:

**1. Trip Duration Distribution:**

- Most users spent less than 20 minutes on their bike trips.
- The majority of trips fall within the one-hour time frame.

**2. Start Ride Hours:**

- The peak usage times resemble typical commuting hours and school hours.
- Most trips occur during the morning (7-9 AM) and afternoon (4-6 PM) hours.

**3. User Type Distribution:**

- Over 90% of users are subscribers, indicating a strong loyalty to the GoBike system.
- Customers, while fewer in number, still contribute to a notable portion of the user base.

**4. Gender Distribution:**

- There are significantly more male users than female users.
- The distribution of user type does not differ significantly between genders.

**5. Age Distribution:**

- The majority of users fall within the age range of 21 to 40 years old.
- Most commuting activities occur within this age group.

**6. User Type and Gender Interaction:**

- Regardless of gender, the distribution of user type (subscriber vs. customer) looks similar.
- Subscribers constitute the majority in both male and female user groups.

**7. User Type and Age Interaction:**

- The age distribution looks similar for both subscribers and customers.
- Most users, regardless of user type, are in the 21-40 age range.

**8. Duration Discrepancy Between User Types:**

- Surprisingly, the overall usage duration for customers is longer than for subscribers.
- Subscribers tend to have shorter ride durations, while customers are willing to ride for a longer duration.

**9. Gender and Age Interaction:**

- The male count far exceeds the female count, consistent with the known demographics.
- In the context of a 10-minute ride duration, males of all age groups show consistent numbers, while females, especially those over 40, exhibit a noticeable decrease.

## Reflection on Data Exploration Steps:

**1. Univariate Exploration:**

- Identified the distribution of trip duration, start ride hours, user types, gender, and age.
- Revealed the dominance of subscribers, the prevalence of male users, and the concentration of users in the 21-40 age group.

**2. Bivariate Exploration:**

- Explored interactions between user types, genders, and age groups.
- Analyzed the relationship between user type and ride duration, discovering unexpected patterns.

**3. Multivariate Exploration:**

- Examined interactions between user type, age, and duration.
- Discovered nuanced patterns in the relationship between gender, age, and ride duration.

**4. Summary and Reflection:**

- Compiled key findings into a concise summary.
- Acknowledged unexpected results and formulated hypotheses for further investigation.
- Recognized patterns and trends that provide insights into user behavior and preferences.

Overall, the exploration uncovered intriguing relationships between user characteristics and bike ride patterns, laying the foundation for deeper analysis and hypothesis testing.
